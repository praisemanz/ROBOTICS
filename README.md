## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical Design

### 1. **Drivetrain**
- **Type:** 4-wheel tank drive using omni-wheels for agility.  
- **Motors:** 4 V5 Smart Motors (2 per side).  
- **Purpose:** High maneuverability for navigating between stakes and goals.  
- **Gear Ratio:** Standard 1:1 for consistent torque and speed balance.

### 2. **Lift Mechanism**
- **Type:** 4-bar linkage (parallel arm lift).  
- **Function:** Raises and lowers the intake assembly while maintaining horizontal alignment.  
- **Motor:** 1 Smart Motor with gear reduction for stability.  
- **Range of Motion:** Ground pickup ‚Üí mid-stake height.

### 3. **Ring Intake**
- **Type:** Passive slope with guiding rails.  
- **Mechanism:** Gravity-assisted ring pickup as the robot drives forward.  
- **Add-on Option:** Roller intake for faster ring collection (custom modification).

### 4. **Scoring / Pusher System**
- **Type:** Motor-driven pusher plate.  
- **Purpose:** Pushes or releases rings onto stakes accurately.  

### 5. **Goal Mover (Attachment)**
- **Type:** Front-mounted fork or pusher bar.  
- **Function:** Push or drag mobile goals to scoring zones.  
- **Optional Automation:** Vision-assisted targeting (if sensor attached).
